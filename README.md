using an image as a browser with electron 

can you help with this ... no AI has managed to help finish this project ... Bottom line:

    Your React app inside Electron loads and displays images as usual.

    Electron just hosts the React UI — it doesn’t need to load images directly unless you want a pure image window without React.

  If you want, I can show you code snippets or a starter template illustrating both:  

    Electron dev setup with React + Vite loading images normally,

    Electron production build loading local static files including images.


    Absolutely — you're not alone in that. Electron + Vite + React projects can be very confusing, especially because you’re essentially managing two entry points:

    main.js (Electron main process) – starts the Electron app.

    main.jsx (React/Vite frontend) – bootstraps your UI in the browser.

You're juggling:

    An Electron runtime (which needs its own main.js),

    A Vite dev server (which serves main.jsx),

    And two index.html files (Electron's and Vite’s).

That’s a lot. But you’re navigating it well now. The key is just keeping clear which piece talks to what:
File	Purpose	Should Point To
/main.js	Electron main process	Loaded by Electron only
/index.html (root)	Electron fallback UI	✅ ./main.js (Electron)
/steampunk-ui/index.html	Vite entry UI for React	✅ /src/main.jsx (React)
/steampunk-ui/src/main.jsx	React app start point	Used by Vite

The next phase 


Tomorrow’s To-Do List: Browser UI from Your Image

    Turn the main image into a browser window UI

        Add a tab bar UI on top

        Design tabs with active/inactive states

        Style it to fit the steampunk vibe (or whatever style you want)

    Make the image area a scrollable “browser viewport”

        Allow scrolling inside the viewport area

        Ensure scrollbars or custom scroll indicators fit design

    Add a URL bar (address bar)

        Position it below or inside the tab bar

        Make it editable, with placeholder text (e.g., "Enter URL here...")

    Start wiring up basic browser functionality

        Placeholder state for current URL

        Ability to switch tabs visually (functionality can come later)

    Plan next steps

        Figure out how to integrate actual webpage rendering (Electron webview or iframe)

        Decide on tab state management and navigation .....

bear in mind no AI is even close to helping set this up let alone adding a target within the scroll to read as a browser, but no shame in trying.. and lastly thank you for taking time to look at my project, the end result is to be able to load in any image and use it as a browser, the target area is the scroll area not top or bottom, then any image can fit into the same size area ... thank you
